        Dear Emily,

        When I am without you it feels as if I am a spectator to my own life.
        The days blur past me as I reminisce and anticipate our time together.
        But when we are finally united, I cherish every moment and detail:
        the slight part in your hair,
        the gentle furrowing of your brows while you peruse the menu.
        How can someone be so effortlessly endearing?
        I snap a picture in a futile attempt to capture the scene,
        You catch me. We laugh.
        
        We end up at the park, sitting on a bench.
        You wrap around my arm, your head falls upon my shoulder.
        You tell me you love me, but I already know:
        by the way your skin brushes mine
        and the hydrangeas bloom.
        The sun beats down as to evict us.
        We leave, but I remain.
        
        Love,
        Frank
